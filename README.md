### Project Overview
---

The Heart Disease Dataset Dashboard provides a visual analysis of data related to individuals with heart disease. The dataset captures clinical attributes, gender distribution, average cholesterol level, chest pain types and overall summary statistics. Using interactive visualizations, the project aims to help users identify patterns and trends that could inform medical research, diagnostics or healthcare analytics.

### Project Objectives
---
The goal is to;
- evaluate porportion of males and females in the dataset and their prevalence in heart disease cases.
- visualize the relationship between cholesterol levels and age to identify critical patterns in heart disease risks.
- offer healthcare analysts, researchers, stakeholders a comprehensive tool for understanding clinical factors contributing to heart disease.
   
### Data Source
---
The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset]

### Tool Used
---
- PowerBI
  
1. Data Integration
2. Data Transformation
3. Data Visualization

###  Data Analysis Process
---

Data Integration: This involve downloading the dataset as excel file from Kaggle and uploading it into PowerBI.

Data Transformation: Once the data was loaded, I cleaned my dataset using Power Query Editor.

Data Visualization: The use of various visual elements (charts, graphs, cards) to represent data visually.

### Results
---

- **`Gender Distribution`**: The dataset shows a higher number of male compared to females, which represents 68.21% of males and 31.79% of females.

- **`Average Age`**: The average age of individuals in the dataset is 54 years, giving an indication of the demographic profile of the population at risk of heart disease.

- **`Cholesterol by Age`**: The chart shows an average cholesterol by age, with a noticeable rise in cholesterol levels in older individuals. Thia could suggest a correlation between higher cholesterol levels and increased age.
  
- **`Chest Pain Types`**: The chart shows that  **`Type 0`** is the most prevalent type **`(47.35%)`**, followed by **`Type 2`** with **`(28.48%)`**. **`Type 1 and 3`** are less frequent, with **`Type 1`** being 16.56% and **`Type 3`** 7.6%.
  
- **`Exercise Induced Angina`**: The chart indicates that while majority of individuals **`(67.22%)`** in this dataset do not report experiencing exercise induced angina i.e do not show symptoms during physical exertion, a notable portion **`(32.78%)`** does, which could be an indicator of potential heart disease or compromised cardiovascular health.

- **`FBS >120mg/dl`**: A smaller group has a fasting blood sugar level above 120 mg/dl, which may indicate a higher risk of diabetes or metabolic issues.

- **`Average Max Heart Rate by Age`**: This line chart tracks the average maximum heart rate (HR) of individuals across different age groups.
As individuals age, their maximum heart rate tends to decrease. Younger individuals have higher peak heart rates, while older individuals show significantly lower maximum heart rates, likely due to reduced cardiovascular fitness and natural age-related declines in heart function.

- **`Average Resting BP by Age`**: The graph indicates that as people age, there is a gradual increase in average resting BP, particularly after the age of 50. The spike in BP values around 70-80 years is noticeable, which could suggest that older individuals tend to experience higher blood pressure, potentially increasing their risk of heart disease.

  
### Actionable Insights
---

- Early Screening and Preventative Care: Start heart disease and diabetes screenings in middle age (40-45), focusing on cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar levels. For those with elevated readings, develop personalized treatment plans that include lifestyle changes and medications if necessary.

- Gender-Specific Health Strategies: Develop targeted health programs for both men and women, considering that men and women might experience different heart disease risks and symptoms.

- Health Education and Lifestyle Changes: Promote regular physical activity, healthy eating, and stress management as part of heart disease prevention for individuals in their 40s and 50s. Those with a history of chest pain or risk factors should be encouraged to adopt a heart-healthy lifestyle immediately.

- Increased Monitoring for Older Individuals: Given the age-related increase in blood pressure, cholesterol, and decreased exercise capacity, encourage individuals aged 50 and above to engage in regular medical check-ups and cardiac health monitoring.

- Encourage cardiac stress testing for individuals reporting exercise-induced chest pain, particularly in those with known risk factors for heart disease.

- Regular screening for diabetes or prediabetes in middle-aged adults should be recommended, as elevated fasting blood sugar is linked to cardiovascular issues.
