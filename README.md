### Project Overview
---

The Heart Disease Dataset Dashboard provides a visual analysis of data related to individuals with heart disease. The dataset captures clinical attributes, gender distribution, average cholesterol level, chest pain types and overall summary statistics. Using interactive visualizations, the project aims to help users identify patterns and trends that could inform medical research, diagnostics or healthcare analytics.

### Project Objectives
---
The goal is to;
- evaluate porportion of males and females in the dataset and their prevalence in heart disease cases.
- visualize the relationship between cholesterol levels and age to identify critical patterns in heart disease risks.
- offer healthcare analysts, researchers, stakeholders a comprehensive tool for understanding clinical factors contributing to heart disease.
   
### Data Source
---
The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset]

### Tool Used
---
- PowerBI
  
1. Data Integration
2. Data Transformation
3. Data Visualization

###  Data Analysis Process
---

Data Integration: This involve downloading the dataset as excel file from Kaggle and uploading it into PowerBI.

Data Transformation: Once the data was loaded, I cleaned my dataset using Power Query Editor.

Data Visualization: The use of various visual elements (charts, graphs, cards) to represent data visually.

### Results
---

- **`Gender Distribution`**: The dataset shows a higher number of male compared to females, which represents 68.21% of males and 31.79% of females.

- **`Average Age`**: The average age of individuals in the dataset is 54 years, giving an indication of the demographic profile of the population at risk of heart disease.

- **`Cholesterol by Age`**: The chart shows an average cholesterol by age, with a noticeable rise in cholesterol levels in older individuals. Thia could suggest a correlation between higher cholesterol levels and increased age.
  
- **`Chest Pain Types`**: The chart shows that  **`Type 0`** is the most prevalent type **`(47.35%)`**, followed by **`Type 2`** with **`(28.48%)`**. **`Type 1 and 3`** are less frequent, with **`Type 1`** being 16.56% and **`Type 3`** 7.6%.
  
- **`Exercise Induced Angina`**: The chart indicates that while majority of individuals **`(67.22%)`** in this dataset do not report experiencing exercise induced angina i.e do not show symptoms during physical exertion, a notable portion **`(32.78%)`** does, which could be an indicator of potential heart disease or compromised cardiovascular health.

  
### Recommendations
---

- Optimize Basic Subscription Offerings: Given that the Basic subscription is the most popular, consider adding incremental value to this tier to retain customers who may eventually switch to competitors offering more benefits at a similar price point. This could include limited premium features to encourage upsells.

- Targeted Upsell and Retention Strategy for Premium and Standard Subscribers: Since Premium and Standard subscriptions generate substantial revenue, create tailored marketing campaigns to retain these customers and potentially encourage Basic users to upgrade. Offering occasional incentives or exclusive content for Standard and Premium users might increase their perceived value and satisfaction.

- Loyalty Programs for High-Value Customers: Introduce loyalty rewards or personalized offers for high-value subscribers like Liam, Mike, and Sophia to retain these valuable customers. A loyalty program could enhance customer retention, especially for the top revenue-generating users.

- Focus on New Customer Acquisition: With only 20 unique customers, scaling up customer acquisition efforts could have a significant impact on total revenue. Expanding marketing efforts to target a larger audience and increase the customer base could help mitigate risks associated with relying heavily on a few high-value customers.

### Conclusion
---

The analysis reveals that the Basic subscription plan drives the most revenue, indicating a customer preference for affordable options. A few high-value customers contribute significantly to total revenue, emphasizing the need for effective retention strategies for these key accounts. Expanding the customer base, enhancing value propositions for Premium and Standard plans, and introducing loyalty programs could improve revenue stability and growth. Additionally, understanding regional performance trends could unlock opportunities for targeted marketing and further revenue generation.
